## Log In / Sign Up

This authentication code purpose is to only allow authorized people to create accounts. To do this they should press the "Sign Up" button on the top right corner and fill their information (Fig. 13).

## Authenticated Users

Authenticated Users have access to two special features such as notifications and moliceiros information.

#### Notifications

When users log in there will be a welcome notification. There will also be a notification if a service is down specifying the service (object detection or sniffing) as well as the location and time of this malfunction. (Fig. 13 & Fig. 14)

Besides appearing the notifications will also be saved in the bell icon. If the bell has a little circle it means that there are unread notifications. To clear the notifications saved in the bell as well as the ones appearing the user may click the button 'clear all' that appears after clicking the bell icon.

## Moliceiros Information

This authenticated users only page displays information about moliceiros.

#### Cards

The cards are separated by companies and each card shows a certain moliceiro data. The data shown is the number of devices detected by sniffing in real time.

## Administrators

Administrators are special authenticated users. Besides the normal features that an authenticated user has access to they also have access to a 'manage accounts' page.



## Manage Accounts

This page allows the administrators to revoke admins, make admins, remove authenticated users and validate accounts (Fig. 17). On the top of the page are the Administrators accounts with their name and email, as well as button to 'revoke admin' (Fig. 18). On the middle of the page the Administrators can see the normal authenticated users, their name and email. Each user also has two options on their card which are 'remove' and 'make admin' (Fig. 19). The account validation is on the bottom part of the page and is another safety measure (Fig. 20).

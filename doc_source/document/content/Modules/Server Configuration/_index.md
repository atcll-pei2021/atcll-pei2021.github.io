The following topics describe the server configuration following the work flow to do so:
- The WebAppDev repository was cloned to the virtual machine
###### Gunicorn
- A service of gunicorn was created to run the web application using **eventlet**  on the same address and port of socket instanced on the web application.
The file is located in **/etc/systemd/system/webapp.service**

```
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn instance to serve PEI2021_NAP project
After=network.target

[Service]
User=hugolardosa
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=path/WebAppDev
Environment="PATH=path/WebAppDev/avenv/bin"
ExecStart=path/WebAppDev/avenv/bin/gunicorn --worker-class eventlet -w 1 --bind="0.0.0.0:5000" app:app

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

It's important to mention the gunicorn run atributes (**gunicorn --worker-class eventlet -w 1 --bind="0.0.0.0:5000" app:app**)
 - **--worker-class eventlet -w 1** These attributes are used to run the web server using the asynchronous process for socket.io
 - **--bind="0.0.0.0:5000"** Indicates gunicorn the address and port the app and socket is running, **NEEDS TO BE THE SAME AS THE ONES IN THE PYTHON APP**
 - **app:app** Indicates gunicorn the name and attribute of the flask web application

We need to run the webapp service, so it will always be running using **sudo systemctl start webapp**

###### NGINX

We then need to configure the NGINX reverse proxy server, we need to link the local gunicorn and redirect it to the **dev.aveiro-open-lab.pt**.
- The file is located in **/etc/nginx/sites-available/webapp**

We start the file by pointing the / in the server to the local web app (0:0:0:0:5000)
```
server{
        server_name dev.aveiro-open-lab.pt;

        location / {
            include proxy_params;
            proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:5000;
        }

```
Then, we need to point the /socket.io on the server to the local socket 0.0.0.0:5000 one
```
        location /socket.io{
         include proxy_params;
         proxy_http_version 1.1;
         proxy_buffering off;
         proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
         proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
         proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:5000/socket.io;
        }
```
The rest of the file was generated by certbot so we can have the webapp running on https
```
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/dev.aveiro-open-lab.pt/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/dev.aveiro-open-lab.pt/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
server{
if ($host = dev.aveiro-open-lab.pt) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot


        listen 80;
        server_name dev.aveiro-open-lab.pt;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot

}
```
We need to run the nginx service, so it will always be running using **sudo systemctl start nginx**

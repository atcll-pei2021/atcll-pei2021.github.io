The following topics describe the server configuration following the work flow to do so:
- The WebAppDev repository was cloned to the virtual machine
###### Gunicorn
- A service of gunicorn was created to run the web application using **gevent**  on the same address and port of socket instanced on the web application.
The file is located in **/etc/systemd/system/webapp.service**

```
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn instance to serve PEI2021_NAP project 
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/atcll-webapp-flask
Environment="PATH=/atcll-webapp-flask/venv/bin"
ExecStart=/atcll-webapp-flask/venv/bin/gunicorn '__init__:create_app()' -k gevent --worker-connections 1000 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

It's important to mention the gunicorn run atributes (**gunicorn '__init__:create_app()' -k gevent --worker-connections 1000 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000**)
 - **gevent --worker-connections 1000** These attributes allow for the server to handle multiple requests and use server sent envents
 - **--bind="0.0.0.0:5000"** Indicates gunicorn the address and port the app and socket is running, **NEEDS TO BE THE SAME AS THE ONE IN THE NGINX CONFIGURATION FILE**
 - **'__init__:create_app()'** Indicates gunicorn the name and attribute of the flask web application

We need to run the webapp service, so it will always be running using **sudo systemctl start webapp**

###### NGINX

We then need to configure the NGINX reverse proxy server, we need to link the local gunicorn and redirect it to the **dev.aveiro-open-lab.pt**.
- The file is located in **/etc/nginx/sites-available/webapp**

We start the file by pointing the / in the server to the local web app (0:0:0:0:5000)
```
server{
	server_name dev.aveiro-open-lab.pt;

	location / {
            include proxy_params;
	    proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:5000;
	    proxy_buffering off;
    	    proxy_cache off;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header Connection '';
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
	    proxy_http_version 1.1;
            chunked_transfer_encoding off;
        }


```

The rest of the file was generated by certbot so we can have the webapp running on https
```
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/dev.aveiro-open-lab.pt/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/dev.aveiro-open-lab.pt/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
server{
if ($host = dev.aveiro-open-lab.pt) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot


        listen 80;
        server_name dev.aveiro-open-lab.pt;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot

}
```
We need to run the nginx service, so it will always be running using **sudo systemctl start nginx**
